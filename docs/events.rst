.. module:: acid.events

The `acid.events` module defines a set of events that may be fired when some
mutation occurs on a collection.

An event function may be used as a decorator applied to a method of an
:py:mod:`acid.meta` Model, in which case the function will be associated with
the Model's :py:class:`Collection <acid.Collection>` when it is created:

.. code-block:: python

    class Account(acid.meta.Model):
        @acid.events.on_create
        def generate_password(self):
            """Assign a password to the account during creation."""
            self.password = passlib.generate(chars=8)

Events registered against against a class will also fire for any modifications
to instances of any subclasses. Note that notification order is most-specific
to least-specific.

Alternatively they may be registered for any free-standing function against
any model or :py:class:`Collection <acid.Collection>`:

.. code-block:: python

    def generate_password(acct):
        self.password = passlib.generate(chars=8)

    # Works against a Model class:
    acid.events.on_create(generate_password, target=Account)

    # Or a Collection instance:
    store.add_collection('accounts')
    acid.events.on_create(generate_password, target=store['accounts'])


Model vs. engine events
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This interface attempts to unify two very different kinds of events: those
occurring logically within the application's data model, and those occurring as
a result of interaction with the storage engine. When applied to
:py:class:`acid.meta.Model`, most event types rely only on in-memory state
tracked by the model class, whereas those applied to
:py:class:`acid.Collection` relate to the state of the storage engine as
reported at the time of the mutation.

The reason for having both types is that usually Model events are good enough
for application use, but storage engine events are needed to robustly implement
features such as indexing. Instead of burying the storage engine events within
Acid's implementation, they are exposed to user code.


Observing Events
++++++++++++++++

Subscribing to certain events will cause a less efficient strategy to be
adopted when interacting with the storage engine. Engines like
:py:class:`LmdbEngine <acid.engines.LmdbEngine>` support efficient
*read-modify-write* operations, whereas others such as :py:class:`PlyvelEngine
<acid.engines.PlyvelEngine>` have reads that are more expensive than writes. An
*observing event* is one that causes the storage engine to read and return any
previous record value during a write operation. Even for engines that support
fast *read-modify-write* operations, emitting the event further requires
decoding of the old record value. Therefore where possible, prefer subscribing
to a non-observing event if it fits your use case.

        **constraint**, No, No
        **on_create**, No, —
        **on_update**, No, No
        **on_delete**, No, —
        **on_commit**, No, No
        **after_create**, No, Yes
        **after_update**, No, No

        **after_replace**, Yes, Yes
        **after_abort**, No, No
        **after_commit**, No, No

While it is possible to support `on_create` and `on_delete` engine events,
these would necessitate extra roundtrips for any engine that relies on the
network, unlike the `after_*` variants which can be supported by a single
"mutate and return previous" message. Additionally for networked storage
systems that lack transactions, it is more likely the single message can be
supported as an atomic operation.


Debugging
+++++++++

Since it is possible to subscribe to events on a base clase, it is possible to
subscribe to events on :py:class:`acid.meta.Model` itself, thus capturing all
database operations. This may be useful for diagnostics:

::

    def log_create(model):
        print 'Model created!', model

    def log_delete(model):
        print 'Model deleted!', model

    def install_debug_helpers():
        if config.DEBUG:
            acid.events.after_create(log_create, acid.meta.Model)
            acid.events.after_delete(log_delete, acid.meta.Model)

Transaction Events
++++++++++++++++++

These may be applied to a :py:class:`Model <acid.meta.Model>`,
:py:class:`Collection <acid.Collection>`, or :py:class:`Store <acid.Store>`. In
the case of Models or collections, the subscription is proxied through to the
associated store.
