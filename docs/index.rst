Acid
####

**Acid** enhances any ordered-map style database engine to provide something
like an *SQLite for NoSQL*, a sweet spot between the ease of managing data with
an external DBMS, and the high performance and flexibility of an in-process
database.

Features:

    :ref:`Secondary Index Management <indices>`

        Secondary indices may be expressed as Python functions, with
        corresponding index entries automatically maintained as the records in
        a collection change. Single lookups, prefix, and range queries are
        supported on both primary keys and secondary indices, iterating forward
        or in reverse.

    :ref:`Order-preserving Tuple Encoding <keys>`

        Keys and index entries are expressed as tuples, which are written to
        the engine using a compact, reversible encoding that preserves the
        tuple's order. By exposing the engine's order to the user, complex
        clustering hierarchies can be expressed without resorting to custom
        encodings, error-prone string manipulation, or unnecessary indices to
        work around limitations of the database model.

    :ref:`Batch Record Compression <batch-compression>`

        Lookup efficiency may be traded for storage efficiency incrementally,
        by controlling the batch size or by only compressing infrequently
        accessed subsets of a collection. For many applications a combination
        of clustering and compression allows 3x-5x+ improvement in storage
        efficiency, while still providing read performance exceeding that of an
        external DBMS.

    :ref:`Declarative Interface <meta>`

        A :py:class:`Model <acid.meta.Model>` class is provided that
        transparently maintains a compact record encoding, and provides a
        convenient ORM-like storage interface familiar to many developers.

    :ref:`Mutation Events <events>`

        Functions can be registered for invocation prior to or after any
        create, update, replacement, or deletion. A function may modify the
        record, implement a constraint, or trigger some external process.

    :ref:`One Engine, Many Collections <intro>`

        Similar to a regular DBMS, the storage engine may contain multiple
        collections. Each collection is assigned a short (usually 1 byte) key
        prefix, and may have its own encoding, compression strategy, and index
        functions defined.

    :ref:`Configurable Database Engine <engines>`

        `LMDB <http://symas.com/mdb/>`_, `LevelDB
        <https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/>`_, `Kyoto Cabinet
        <http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/>`_, and a basic in-memory skiplist
        engine are supported by default. Additional engines may be supported by
        implementing a single class. Significant effort is being made to
        integrate efficiently with LMDB, so that in certain configurations, no
        memory copies need occur for the majority of reads within a
        transaction.

    :ref:`Configurable Record Encoding <record-encoder>`

        `JSON <http://json.org/>`_, `MsgPack <http://msgpack.org/>`_, `Pickle
        <http://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html>`_, and `Thrift
        <http://thrift.apache.org/>`_ record encodings are supported by
        default. Additional encodings may be supported by instantiating a
        single class. Decoding can be disabled during reads, allowing
        the storage encoding to be aligned directly with whatever output a
        server generates (e.g. JSON), without necessitating a pointless
        decode/re-encode step.
